topic: grades Firstlyin response to someone arguing that they don’t know anyone opposed to being forces to take all classes mandatory S/NCI know several several people that areAs far as the people worried about medical students being in difficult positions where they can’t take classes S/NCI can’t imagine that a medical school would not understand if you explained that you were unable to cope in the middle of a GLOBAL PANDEMICAs far as any kind of reason goesthat’s as good as gets and I’m certain as someone with 2 pre-med siblings at Brown that you will have the opportunity to explainThey'll understand if you needed to S/NC because you were in a de-stabilising position or your family was affected but someone else was in a more privileged positionHOWEVERhow will others who need their grades this semesterespecially upperclassmenbe able to cope with thisespecially when they don’t have had reduced courseloads or a bad GPA due to similarly extenuating circumstances in the past few semesters (severe mental or physical health issuesloss of a family member etc.)? Although people argue that those who want S/NC to be an optionnot something that is forcedshould “get off their high horse”I hope you guys can at least attempt to sympathise with people in this positionSome students need these grades due to equally extenuatingdifficult circumstances in the pastand deserve the option to take them for a grade if they want tojust as those in difficult circumstances now deserve the option to take them S/NC."

topic: grades Spicy take: the to-SNC-or-not-to-SNC debate is really just exposing the unethical nature of grading academic workThose who’s families cannot support themwho never learned how to write an essay in their 50-person high school English classwho worry about affording food (let alone a 2 week supply) are set up to sinkThose with privilege and institutional knowledge get waterwings and swimming lessonsthen get an A as a trophy to show off their hard earned (?) successThere are of course exceptions; there is no shortage of successfulbrilliantunderprivileged peoplenor a dearth of dedicatedhardworking silver-spoonersBut this slight flexibility of the grading system is just enough to fool us into believing in meritocracyNever forget that we are primarily graded on our privilegenot our abilityespecially in a moment of global crisis."
topic: grades (firstlyI'm in support of making all classes s/nc) When people go back homethe existing disparities in class privilege become even more apparent than on campusIt's not about the gradeIt's about making sure that people are not penalized for having less resources back homeWhen students are expected to worry about basic needs like food and health on top of studying for classes (or even having a space to productively study)while others live in luxury of having office/study space within their homes and no lack of foodI don't think the option to s/nc is enough I'm premed and low-incomeAlready my low-income status is a disadvantage for me in med school admissionsbut me and my decision to s/nc while worrying about food security (against another applicant whose resources allowed them to keep up with the rigid grading system) should not have to count against me and further add to my anxiety during this times/nc does not mean you are not working hardBut please consider your privilege."

It’s important to recognize that lots of students who worked really hard and did get good grades throughout the semester would be at a massive disadvantage going forward given reasons of accessibility (for exampleZoom isn’t available in some countries)or just because learning remotely and/or in different time zones is a massive barrier to many and not all professors are so accommodating Although I understand that some people feel like giving everyone A’s drives up grade inflation and thus decreases the value of their own hard workit’s also very true that only giving students the option to S/NC courses if they face significant barriers even if they worked really hard before can similarly (and likely to a greater extent) devalue their workMany of you don’t want to put everyone on S/NC because of this exact reasonand it’s quite ableist to expect that hardworking students would either have to take a lower grade due to the barriers they now face or opt into S/NC for their courses and decrease the “value” of their transcript I think the net loss in whatever harm the grade inflation does (I personally doubt employers and grad schools will really look at or judge the measures Brown takes to mitigate the toll of this pandemic on our academic abilities) of giving everyone A’s will be massively offset by its emotional and academic boon alongside making up for the increased barriers many - if not most - students now face without forcing them to have to choose between a lower grade and “devaluing” their work through S/NC In my mindthe most widely appealing solution is to allow students to freeze their grades where they are right now as a representation of their traditional academic performance or unfreeze them if they  want to try to raise those gradesbut I nonetheless think that giving everyone A’s is already far better than either keeping the system as it is or only giving out extended S/NC deadlines."

If you didn't qualify for financial aidis brown not reimbursing for room/board? It's a lot of money that is going down the drain...
Are people not on financial aid not getting reimbursed for room/board? Just because certain individuals don't qualify for financial aid does not mean that the university is not responsible for reimbursing them for housing and meals when they were mandated to leave.
You seethat’s what I’m talking aboutI wrote a DB saying that Buzz Lightyear getting an A doesn’t belittle your own gradeThensomeone answers: “I personally think I (and everyone else who worked super hard for the first half of the semester!) shouldn’t have their hard work erased by giving everyone A’s”  your hard work won’t get erased! You still can carry your pride about it and you will get your deserved A! why is it that you people derive happiness from being better than others? You aimedyou workedyou got an AWhy the fuck do you care about others people grades?  alsothe point about graduate schools and employees doesn’t make sense AT ALL because we are talking about 1/8 semestersone that is amid a fucking global pandemic crisisGraduate schools absolutely WONT go like “uh I can see his Xth semester is all Aslet me do the calculations...Hm oksó he went to Brown during Coronavirus seasonthat means his A is falselet’s not admit this guy ha-ha-ha”"

Extending the S/NC deadline doesn’t really help people who want to go to grad/med school As long as there’s a choicethose students (especially pre-meds) won’t be able to take advantage because it puts them in a worse spot than other premeds that don’t take this option MIT’s solution is to make all classes “PE/NE” for “passextenuating circumstances”/“no recordextenuating circumstances” I think it’s safe to say that COVID counts as a major problem for all our academic pursuitsand the transition to online classes makes things extraordinarily difficult for those who rely on attending in-person lectures and sections to learn Brown should follow suit and make things mandatory “S/NC” but with an asterisk to say that this was an administrative decision due to “extenuating circumstances”."
People are making the case for extending the S/NC deadlinewhich makes sense...but is giving EVERYONE an extended S/NC deadline necessary (and conducive to rigor)? Would it be better if the administration grants these extensions on a case-by-case basis (but at the same time urges the deans to be understanding for a variety of circumstances)?  AlsoI hope that IF there are classes that are still doing closed-book/timed examsplease ensure that there is some effective proctoring mechanism (ex: real-time proctoring over zoom? videotaping the exam session?)Againif this is especially difficult for some studentsthere should be accommodating measures after discussions"

For people saying that giving everyone all As or mandating S/NC doesn’t make sense for students who need these grades for med and grad schooleven just reopening the snc deadline doesn’t give everyone the same freedom to choose to take their classes S/NC even if their housing situation does not allow it because premed people still need to take classes for a gradeHow else are they going to explain it? Mandatory S/NC given the current circumstances could be explained for grad school and med school appsMaking it an option is not fair to everyone eitherPeople get off your high horseMany universities are already making these accommodationsplease do not be this selfish.

I am so worried that Brown is going to force us to be mandatory S/NCI think the university should open the S/NC deadlineso people can make decisions rather than forcing this on everyoneI am so nervous that I feel like throwing up.
Will mail services continue to stay open for those remaining on campus?
does anyone know what happens to the people staying on campus? when do we move outwhen do we get assigned new rooms? i haven’t heard from res life since they approved my petition to stay
TL;DR - Brown should extend the S/NC deadlines once professors make virtual classes clearerforcing everyone to take classes S/NC is extreme and unfair  HonestlyI think the best policy would be if Brown extended the S/NC deadline for all students after Professors have clearly explained how their classes and exams are going to be conducted for the rest of the semesterI completely believe that it’s only fair that students that might struggle due to these terrible and super de-stabilising circumstances deserve the option to take their classes S/NCHoweverit’s valid that a lot of students really need their grades this semester that they’ve worked real  lot hard for to boost their GPA’sespecially rising juniors and seniorsIt’s unfair to be forced to take classes S/NC for students that have worked very hard and are willing and able to handle with virtual classes for the sake of their GPAs."
obviouslythere are bigger fish to frybut i certainly hope Brown does not forget about Phi beta kappa and magna cum laude...

I just feel like the intense work ethiclong hoursand general grind mentality that seems second-nature at Brown won’t be at all possible under these unprecedented circumstancesRight nowat least we have a bit of time to get as settled as possible into this new uncertain realityBut as things get worse (which they will)some of our loved ones will very likely fall illwe may get sick ourselvesand overall things will be far from normalAnd I really don’t know how to approach “business as usual” in the midst of all thisI don’t want to give up on the semester because I’ve worked so hard up to this point (we all have!)but things just feel fundamentally different in the world since last week.

With everyone leaving/ practicing social distancing/isolationI thought I'd share some thoughts on how to maintain social relationships in the next few months! I've been in a long distance relationship for two yearsand over that timeI've learned a few things about keeping up healthy connections with people who are far from you 1Treat video chats/phone calls as ""real"" timeIt's easy to feel some separation when talking through a devicebut it's important to approach these calls with the mindset that you areactuallyhanging out togetherYour relationship with this friend or partner is not ""paused"" just because you are not in the same place!  2Make a schedule with your friends to have regular calls/contactIt will be very important to have this structure 3Get creative with activities! Watch a show togetherplay video gamesdo yogastart a remote DnD campaignteach each other how to knitetcThere's a lot you can do besides just chatting 4This may be obviousbut communication is keyWith distance from people you care aboutit is important to speak up clearly when you need spacetimeor attention I hope this is helpful! Take care of each other!"

I’m not readyI am not fucking ready to go homeplease tell me there are other seniors that are just completely coming fucking unglued over this because I am losing my goddamn mind and I don’t know what to doI’m either unthinkingly numb or wildly sobbingI haven’t been able to pack a thing and I am not ready to go back to a family that barely tolerates me in a city where I know nobodyI worked so hard to get hereand to stay here despite mental breakdowns and financial inaccessibilityworked my ass off to stay at a university that made it actively difficult for me to attendand now what? Not having enjoyed a single semesterthis was supposed to be the one semester where I had funand finally laid back with my classes to spend more time with my friendsAnd there probably won’t even be commencementso it’s not like I’ll even get to properly graduate and I know the ceremony is not the point of graduating university but it was really fucking important to meAnd suddenly it’s goneI know I should consider myself luckyothers’ circumstances are worse and I shouldn’t be a selfish brat about having my “senior spring” ruinedBut I am just as broken now as when I first heard the newsand I cannot pull myself togetherAm I the only one that feels like this? Like the rug has been completely ripped out from under meand I’ve lost something I will never get back If anythingmaybe some underclassmen will learn from thisDon’t be a stupid piece of shit and trick yourself into thinking this lasts foreverRealize that the people you love here on this campus are people you may never see again after you graduateMake the most of experiences you won’t find anywhere elseor you’ll realize your mistakes too late."

“ByeBruno”  At first I was in disbelief My soulasundercracked apart In piecesand a mounting grief Did plague my sullen heart  I wept and wept amid the ache For friends I will not see And memories I will not make We leave too suddenly  A dream deferredforevermore For time will not return Regardless of a primal roar Or how we hope and yearn  I peel my posters off the wall And box away the past Can things removed exist at all? I think they can —  they last  They last within that treasured space Of memory and mind That does preservein endless grace The things we leave behind  At nightI pass the quiet green Though quiet not for long For laughter lights the shadowed scene (And splendid drunken song)  One last week is all we share And so we fill our plate Not with chickendry and bare But loveabbreviate  The crane is brightso bright indeed Agleam within the night But even it shall soon recede And fade away from sight  And when it doeswhile I am gone When dusk will soon appear I will miss youmiss the dawn For nowI hold you near "

topics: corona discourse I've never been disturbed by the wealth gap on this campusby people wearing Moncler or Canadian Goose coatsby the fact that some of us can elect to work but others have no choice at all until nowThe coronavirus has me feeling the full weight of being a low-income studentIn this moment when many of my peersunencumbered  by  the constraints of financesonly need to concern themselves with putting their items in storage and getting back homeI have to ask: will I have enough to eat if/when I get back home ? Will I be safe at home? How am I going to support my family if I can't work my on-campus job? If I go homewhere am I going to sleepthe couch or the floor? My family doesn't have adequate health insurance so how much can I pay out of pocket to help with medical expenses? How much will the University health insurance cover me out-of-state should I fall ill? Will I have the money for co-pays or a hospital stay? Where should I put my items in storage? Can I afford it?   I hope the University will help financially where it canbut its incredibly isolating when so many of my peers don't have as many layers to think throughIts odd to rub shoulders with the children of some of the world's wealthiest peopleto be just as talentedintelligentand capable but to know the only thing that seperates us is that one of us was born lucky and the other not-so-much To know that much of that wealth was built on the backs of working-class people like me Its odd to know that some students come from families with multiple homessome in isolated locations where they can bunker down and wait this pandemic out comfortablybut some of us have nowhere to go at allI know I'll figure out the answer to all these questions but even now when we are all sufferingwe're not all suffering the sameI feel so vulnerableIt sucks to be low-income at a time like this~Dont forget about low-income kids~

Now that schools including HarvardVanderbiltand Princeton are suspending in person classes and encouraging students to stay home after spring break and have set that precedentit seems likely that Brown might do the same  I understand the need to contain the spread of germsbut is sending us home the best way to do that? We’d be going home to older relatives who are more susceptible to the diseaseand many people would have to return to somewhere they would be at more risk—that doesn’t protect the health nor the best interests of the students  Certain large lectures could be held onlinebut many small discussion coursesperforming arts coursesand labs require to be held in person—and the smaller nature of these courses makes it much simpler to contain virus spreadPlacing suspicion on all in-class meetings would hinder our learning and given the nature of a 4 year degree programwould be lost time that we cannot make up Steps can be taken to prevent the spread of disease on campussuch as targeting specific classes to be held onlineimproving sanitation measuresand having students be wary of their own healthrather than following in the footsteps of other schools that have implemented drastic but not necessarily beneficial measures"

Don't you think it'd be exhausting to watch Trump convince everyone he's senilewith Joe unable to respond without another incident? Do you really want to risk investing in this election for the rest of the yearknowing you're going to lose anyway because the whole country is convinced he's goneonce the media starts talking about it?"

If you answered yesyou should be afraid of this virusIf you didn’tyou won’t freakin die from itit’s basically a cold (the common cold is a coronavirus)Also I get that it’s more serious than a common coldbut you know who’s dying from covid? 95 year olds in nursing homesnot 19 year old college students!  4) each mask you buy endangers EMS who ACTUALLY need the masks to treat people with the virusAlso guess what? If we don’t have maskswe aren’t going to go take care of the patient who’s actually sickand then they’ll spread it around to y’all  5) Please stop buying masks! 6) Washing your hands is so much more effective than wearing an N95 And none of y’all do it! Also like cover your nose when you sneeze/mouth when you cough7)I can’t think of anything else rn I’ll let you know if I have some more points later 8) PLEASE STOP BUYING MASKS! 9) I know it’s unverifiedbut I don’t know how to make it verifiedLoveyour favorite neighborhood EMT!"

Honest question To what extent do you believe that historic oppression of a person’s ancestors can be equated to present-day oppression?  As an exampleI am Jewishand I grew up rarely encountering explicit antisemitism (at least in-person) and I don’t think being Jewish has ever been used against me in a hiring decision or something like that But if you go back just two or three more generationsmy ancestors were beatenkilledimprisonedexiledetcbecause of their religionand that was pretty common on and off for literally thousands of years   My question iswhat does that mean for me?  Black Americans continue to experience discrimination and bigotry that clearly stem from the evils of the past But in my caseall of the horrible stuff that happened to my ancestors doesn’t really harm me in any clear way I think this is a common feeling among American Jews Many of us are pretty well-off socioeconomically We tend to look similar to white Christians We are well represented in politics and other positions That all protects us from a lot of the oppression that our ancestors facedwhich is great But it also allows us and others to forget that Jews have been and are an oppressed people So to what extent can Jews identify as an oppressed group that deserves support and solidarity from others?  Or should a well-off American Jew just be thankful that they are now privilegedunlike their ancestors?  I am asking this in a public forum because I’m interested in what members of other marginalized groups have to say about thisin addition to just other Jews."

This is my second semester at Brownand I feel like the way Brown deals with grades (A/B/C/NC) creates a really corrosive mentality if you are planning to apply to competitive jobs/grad schoolsI've come to approach grades with the attitude that an A should be expecteda B is a disappointmentand a C is a death sentenceI know there is S/NCbut interesting and challenging classes that I want to prove my effort through a grade in become toxic when there are only those three dimensions of evaluationno pluses or minusesI understand that grades aren't the end all be all for after Brownbut they really do matterand Brown's structure really doesn't give an honest full picture of performance in a class.

Don’t belittle my intelligence by prefacing your statement by a disclaimer that I might be too stupid to believe what you’re about to say or that I need you to spell out for me your fucking argumentWHEN THERE IS NO ARGUMENT “I claim that my burger is undercooked.” SHUT THE FUCK UP and show me the BURGER! I have eyesyou don’t have to write down a function describing the temperature of the meat at every point in space and write down the fucking heat equation and explain to me that the burger only cools down out of the ovenIM NOT A FUCKING IDIOT (Talking to someone else:) “I claim that you should put effort into this pset.” EVERYONE SHOULD BE PUTTING EFFORT INTO THEIR GOD DAMNED PSETSDo you really think the person you’re talking to DOESNT fucking know they’re a studentand that their priority should be to do the psets so as to LEARN AND MASTER THEBFUXKING MATERIAL  “I claim that so and do dining hall is better than another dining hall.” you BRAINWASHED TROGDOLYTEI know god damn well that you didn’t conduct a rigorous fuckjng SCIENTIFIC STUDY into what makes dining halls betterDo you not know that what you’re about to say is a fucking OPINION and not a FACT???
